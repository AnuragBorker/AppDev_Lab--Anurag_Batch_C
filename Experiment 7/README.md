# 📋 Registration Form – Flutter App

A simple and modern **Registration Form UI built with Flutter**.  
This project demonstrates how to use **Forms, Dropdowns, Radio buttons, Validation, and Material Design styling** in Flutter.  

It also includes **design assets in the `/figma` folder**, which contain the UI wireframes and style components for the design phase.

- ✅ **SnackBar confirmation** on successful registration  
- ✅ **Clean Material Design styling** with rounded borders, padding, and hint texts  
- 🎨 **Figma design components included** in `/figma` folder for reference
